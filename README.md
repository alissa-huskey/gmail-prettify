Gmail Prettify
==============


A chrome extension to clean up some of the gmail's cruft.

- Hide the Chat and Meet sections of the left sidebar.

- Expand the folders nav (Inbox, Sent, Trash, labels) section to the full
  sidebar height.

- Change the Inbox link background from red to a light gray.


Status
------

This is a trivial personal project. It may be buggy or get out of date when the
Gmail interface changes.

It is not deployed on the Chrome Web Store, but you can clone this repo and
follow the instrucions on the [development](doc/development.md) page to install it locally.

Looks great with [Inbox When Ready](https://inboxwhenready.org/), which hides
your Inbox contents by default.
